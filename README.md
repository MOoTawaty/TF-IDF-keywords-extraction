robotics design construction and use of machines robots to perform tasks done traditionally by human beings robots are widely used in such industries as
automobile manufacture to perform simple repetitive tasks and in industries where work must be performed in environments hazardous to humans many aspects of
robotics involve artificial intelligence robots may be equipped with the equivalent of human senses such as vision touch and the ability to sense temperature
some are even capable of simple decision making and current robotics research is geared toward devising robots with a degree of selfsufficiency that will permit
mobility and decisionmaking in an unstructured environment todayâ€™s industrial robots do not resemble human beings a robot in human form is called an android.
